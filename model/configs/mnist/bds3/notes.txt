300 : bds3_003 with dropout 0.4
301 : bds3_203 (guide blocks) with dropout 0.4, no normalization (even in disc)
026 : separate decoder
100 : switching instance norm (doesn't work)
102 : switching layer norm (works)
201 : skip pooling indices
202 : like 102 but residual decoder has short skip and 3x3 conv
203 : like 102 but with guide blocks
204 : 203 but with 3x3 conv, short skip on residual
205 : 203 but with short skip on residual
206 : 204 with SN only on discriminator
207 : 204 but with non-zero guide block init
208 : basic_block instead of conv_block in 204
209 : like 208 but with init scaled by 0.01
210 : 204 with pixelwise norm instead of spectral norm on generator
211 : 204 but with layer norm in encoder instead of instance norm
212 : msg ...
213 : 204 with equalized init
213b: 213 with init scaled by 0.01
213c: 213 with init scaled by 0.001
213d: 213 with constant init
214 : 213 with pixelnorm on generator
215 : 214 with batch stdev discrimination
216 : 214 with pixelnorm on skinny cat (instead of instance norm)
217 : 214 with no SN on gen
218 : 214 with no SN on gen and disc
219 : 213 with batch stdev discrimination
